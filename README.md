* `R53` - Aimed to determine if there is a relationship between the development of chronic dysphagia in patients with head and neck cancer and timing of placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

* `R96` - Aimed to investigate the relationship of age on QoL and uncertainty for patients with intracranial malignancies and determine if these relationships changes with time. 

* `R107` - Aimed to see if 30-day readmission status is a predictor of mortality at various time points within a two year time-frame for patients admitted at Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia.  

* `R161` - Aimed to evaluate the effect of abruptly changing gadolinium-based contrast agents on the number of allergic-like reactions and to assess whether or not there was a definitive "Weber effect"" in the three years after the switch occurred.

* `R168` - Aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of adverse drug reactions relating to the incidence of delirium and behavioral changes associated with levetiracetam use in the neurologically injured ICU patient.
